# Tiny Machine Learning Project – Football Kick Classification

This project explores the use of TinyML to differentiate between different types of football kicks using accelerometer data.  
It is carried out as part of a fifth semester course in Tiny Machine Learning.  

The system aims to classify four types of kicks:  
- Pass  
- Long pass  
- Cross  
- Shot  

We use the Particle Photon 2 to acquire accelerometer data.  
The accelerometer is mounted near the shoe, and the classification is based on analyzing the distinct acceleration (g-force) patterns produced by each type of kick.
